# ðŸŽ¨ ColorNet

A simple neural network that predicts whether black or white text will be easier to read on a given background color.  

It uses RGB values as input (three nodes), runs them through a hidden layer (ReLU), as well as an activation layer (Sigmoid) and applies backpropagation during training to adjust its weights.

Developed with Python (Flask, NumPy) + HTML/JS frontend. Deployed via. Railway/Vercel.
